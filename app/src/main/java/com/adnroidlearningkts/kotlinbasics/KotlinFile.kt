/**
 *     Kotlin Class: can have only a class.
 *     Kotlin File: can have many classes.
 *
 * Kotlin Class: Android Studio displays it with no extension if the file contains ONLY ONE class.
 *
 * Unlike Java, Kotlin allows you to put certain things outside the class like:
 *
 *     extension functions
 *     constants
 *
 * If you, therefore, add any of the above or another class to the file, Android Studio will change it to "Kotlin File":
 *
 * with extension .kt
 *
 * Removing the above extras, will again show the file as "Kotlin Class"
